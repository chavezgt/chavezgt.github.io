"To define is to limit" -Oscar Wilde

### More Information 
I'd like to think myself as a dynamic person. Sometimes I am a hardcore geek who
doesn't get away from his computer in days, and others some sort of tramp,
hitchiking around, as far away from people and computers as he can. I love to
talk with interesting people about a interesting stuff, and I've been writing
for myself since about 2 years or so. 

Since a long time ago I've been playing with the idea of starting a blog. The
problem is that I had so many different topics I wanted to write about that I
could not find some cohersive force to keep them together. My previous blog
attempts have been frustrated by the availability of tools, and the focus on
getting it "right". Fuck that. I decided to just jump in, KISS, and go for it.
here is the result. I'll write about what I feel like, when I feel like, and you
are welcome to join the discussion. Sometimes it might have to do with
programming/geeky stuff, sometimes about something deeper, sometimes it might
help me keep focus on certain projects (persistence being the key word), I don't
know. I'll try to keep it kind of organized (though if it ends up looking like
my room, or what I think the inside of my head looks like it might be quite
messy...).
